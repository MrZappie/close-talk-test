### Project Description
Close Talk is a peer-to-peer, internet-free chat app that discovers nearby devices and lets you exchange messages directly over local connections. Profiles and conversations  are stored locally.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Wi-Fiâ€™s down, the dataâ€™s slow, and now you have to actuallyâ€¦ talk? In person? Yikes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We let your phones gossip without the internet. They find each other and chat behind your backâ€”delivering your words without leaving the room.

## Technical Details
