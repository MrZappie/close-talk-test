### Project Description
Close Talk is a peer-to-peer, internet-free chat app that discovers nearby devices and lets you exchange messages directly over local connections. Profiles and conversations  are stored locally.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Wi-Fiâ€™s down, the dataâ€™s slow, and now you have to actuallyâ€¦ talk? In person? Yikes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We let your phones gossip without the internet. They find each other and chat behind your backâ€”delivering your words without leaving the room.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: Dart
- Frameworks used: Flutter
- Libraries used: nearby_connections, hive, hive_flutter, shared_preferences, permission_handler, location, device_info_plus,uuid.
- Tools used: Flutter SDK,VS Code,Cursor.ai,

For Hardware:

### Implementation
For Software:

#### Installation
bash
# Prerequisites: Flutter SDK installed and set up
flutter --version

# Get dependencies

Notes:
- The app uses Nearby Connections; testing requires at least two Android devices/emulators with location and Bluetooth/Wiâ€‘Fi Direct enabled.
- On first launch, the app requests required permissions and creates a local profile via Hive.
